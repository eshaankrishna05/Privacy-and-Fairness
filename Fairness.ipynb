Before beginning, you will have to inspect the data and determine the variable of interest (i.e. the outcome) and at least two sensitive features. After each step of your analysis, you will write an in-depth analysis of your results.\n","\n","This notebook has four stages in which we will:\n","1. Import the data, implement a few pre-processing steps, and inspect the data\n","2. Run a short exploratory analysis of the primary variable of interest of your dataset\n","3. Reproduce the logistic regression model  and interpret the estimates\n","4. Compute the predictive accuracy of the risk score labels\n","\n","### Instructions\n","<!-- **Deadline.**  This assignment is due at ****.  Please check the syllabus for late submissions. -->\n","You are expected to write clear, detailed, and complete answers when analysing your data. Lack of this may result in point deductions.\n","\n","**Reminder.** You must submit your own work.  The collaboration policy for the assignments is Consultation Collaboration. You may verbally discuss concepts with your classmates, without exchanging written text, code, or detailed advice.  You must develop your own solution and **submit your own work**.  This means that you **cannot** get your solution from AI tools.   All sources of information used including books, websites, students you talked to, must be cited in the submission.  Please see the course FAQ document for details on this collaboration policy.  We will adhere to current Faculty of Science guidelines on dealing with suspected cases of plagiarism.\n","\n","You must use this notebook to complete your assignment. You will execute the questions in the notebook. The questions might ask for a short answer in text form or for you to write and execute a piece of code. Make sure you enter your answer in either case only in the cell provided. Do not use a different cell and do not create a new cell. Creating new cells for your code is not compatible with the auto-grading system we are using and thus your assignment will not get grading properly and you will lose marks for that question.\n","\n","Your submitted notebook should run on our local installation.  So if you are importing packages not listed in the notebook or using local data files not included in the assignment package, make sure the notebook is self-contained with a requirements.txt file or cells in the notebook itself to install the extra packages.  If we cannot run your notebook, you will lose 50% of the marks, and any additional marks that may be lost due to wrong answers.\n","\n","### Submission Instructions\n","When you are done, you will submit your work from the notebook. Make sure to save your notebook before running it, and then submit on Canvas the notebook file with your work completed. Name your file with your **Student ID number** and the assignment number (ex: 1234567_A2.ipynb). Failure to do so will result in a zero!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"ZfrPg4x30DDJ","nbgrader":{"cell_type":"code","checksum":"b7c09601444fbcee6d56e3e3065e1cb0","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-96ada4da5a0ad7f4","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false,"task":false},"tags":[],"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756405201516,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":5476,"user":{"displayName":"Dolly Pramila","userId":"09150043647736569970"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Don't change this cell; just run it.\n","import numpy as np\n","from numpy.random import default_rng\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy.optimize import minimize\n","import statsmodels.api as sm\n","\n","# These lines do some fancy plotting magic.\n","import matplotlib\n","# This is a magic function that renders the figure in the notebook, instead of displaying a dump of the figure object.\n","%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import warnings\n","warnings.simplefilter('ignore', FutureWarning)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"Evb1ew8P1yp8","nbgrader":{"cell_type":"code","checksum":"eb14e4d27fbbaf39f3f6bdf1c41a2d3b","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-1379add19442788f","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false,"task":false},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756405204461,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"Dolly Pramila","userId":"09150043647736569970"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Don't change this cell; just run it.\n","rng_seed = 42\n","rng = default_rng(rng_seed)\n","rngstate = np.random.RandomState(rng_seed)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"B9tpbJze1yp9","nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"b0a801d9a9088efbf0836db0e0c149a7","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-608b2701efa9f27f","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false,"task":false},"tags":[]},"source":["## Data\n","**Question 1.** We will first load the data, carry out some cleaning and pre-processing, and inspect the data to understand what exploratory steps we will take.

Note that your data may not be already filtered, so there may be rows that are not needed or missing values (NaN).  In your pre-processing, first retain only relevant columns for ease of analysis and inspection.  Relevant columns are those that you will need for analysis in this assignment - please read the whole assignment once over to determine which columns to retain.   You will need to retain all columns with sensitive features, the output columns, and other columns that contain features needed for the analysis.  Remember, it's always a good idea to check first all the columns and do any investigation into your dataset, like you were asked in Question 2.  Once you've retained the columns you want, remove the rows that are missing data (if needed).  \n","\n","Next, determine if you have to do any more filtering (e.g. maybe you only want to consider individuals between 20 and 30 years old).

So the y values for each subgroup will be the number of individuals having a given value divided by the total number of individuals of that subgroup.\n","\n","You can choose how you want to represent the histograms:  separate sub plots side by side, or all on one plot with different colours each, etc.  The axis limits should be same on both plots (same scale) and the plots should have appropriate titles, axis labels, and if needed a

These metrics help us understand whether the model treats different subgroups (in this case, based on the sensitive feature \"sex\" with subgroups \"Female\" and \"Male\") fairly or if there is any bias or disparity in its predictions.\n","\n","**1.\tDemographic Parity Difference:**\n","\n","Demographic parity is a fairness criterion that requires the model to have the same positive prediction rate across different groups defined by a sensitive attribute (in this case, \"sex\"). The Demographic Parity Difference is calculated as the difference in the rate of positive predictions between two subgroups.\n","\n","Demographic Parity: 0 -0.295061\n","\n","This value tells us that there is a significant gap in the rate of positive predictions between the two subgroups. Females have a rate of positive predictions that is about 29.5% lower than that for Males.\n","Demographic parity is often seen as a fairness criterion in contexts where it’s important to ensure that individuals from different groups are treated equally in terms of the outcomes (Model’s predictions). A large disparity like this suggests that the model may be biased against the female subgroup, as it is assigning fewer positive predictions to females than males, potentially leading to unequal access to opportunities or outcomes based on gender.\n","\n","**2. Equal Opportunity Difference:**\n","\n","The Equal Opportunity fairness criterion focuses on ensuring that the model has equal True Positive Rates (TPR) across different groups. TPR is the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified by the model. The Equal Opportunity Difference is the difference in TPR between the two subgroups.\n","\n","Equal Opportunity Difference: -0.06607010875303554\n","\n","This indicates that the True Positive Rate for females is 6.6% lower than for males. This means the model is less effective at correctly identifying positive cases for females than for males.\n","Equal Opportunity ensures that all groups, regardless of their sensitive attributes (here, sex), have an equal chance of being identified as positive when they truly are positive. A negative difference indicates that the model is failing to identify positive cases for females compared to males, which can be considered an unfair treatment of the female subgroup. The model might be underperforming for females, potentially leading to negative consequences for them in certain applications, such as healthcare or hiring, where being correctly identified as \"positive\" could have important outcomes.\n","\n","**3. Equalized Odds Difference:**\n","Equalized odds requires that the model has equal True Positive Rates (TPR) and False Positive Rates (FPR) across all groups. FPR is the proportion of actual negative cases that are incorrectly classified as positive. The Equalized Odds Difference measures the difference in both TPR and FPR between two subgroups.\n","\n","Equalized Odds Differences (TPR, FPR): [-0.06607010875303554, -0.17978100331041508]\n","\n","TPR Difference: The difference in TPR is the same as the Equal Opportunity Difference, showing that the model has a 6.6% lower TPR for females than for males.\n","\n","FPR Difference: The False Positive Rate for females is about 18% lower than for males. This means that females are less likely to be incorrectly classified as positive compared to males.\n","\n","Equalized Odds ensures that the model performs equally well in identifying both true positives and true negatives for all groups. The results show that: The True Positive Rate (TPR) is worse for females than for males, suggesting that females are less likely to be correctly identified as positive cases. The False Positive Rate (FPR) is better for females, meaning females are less likely to be wrongly classified as positive when they are actually negative.\n","\n","While a lower FPR for females might seem beneficial, it could also be a form of bias. It could indicate that the model is being overly cautious with females, potentially under-predicting positive outcomes for them, which may harm them in certain scenarios (e.g., fewer opportunities or benefits for females who deserve them).\n","\n","**Overall Interpretation:**\n","\n","Based on the metrics, the model is not fair.\n","1.\tDemographic Parity: The model has a significant disparity in positive predictions between males and females. Females are significantly less likely to receive a positive prediction compared to males.\n","2.\tEqual Opportunity: The model has a lower True Positive Rate for females compared to males, meaning it is less likely to correctly identify positive cases for females. This is an indication of unfair treatment for females in the model’s decision-making.\n","3.\tEqualized Odds: The model has both a lower True Positive Rate and a lower False Positive Rate for females. The lower TPR indicates the model is less effective at identifying positive cases for females, while the lower FPR could indicate the model is underpredicting positives for females, leading to fewer opportunities or benefits.\n","\n","**Conclusion: **\n","\n","In conclusion, the model currently exhibits unfairness towards females in terms of both the positive prediction rate and the true positive rate, indicating the need for improvement in its fairness with respect to the sensitive feature \"sex.\" The demographic parity difference and equal opportunity difference suggest that the model is biased in favor of the male subgroup.
