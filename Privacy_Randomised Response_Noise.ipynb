Please check the syllabus for late submissions. -->\n","You are expected to write clear, detailed, and complete answers when analysing your data. Lack of this may result in point deductions.\n","\n","**Reminder.** You must submit your own work. The collaboration policy for the assignments is Group Collaboration. You may work together in groups of up to 2.\n"," On Canvas we added a group set called \"Assignment Group\".  We have enabled self-signup for you to signup as a group.  If you don't select your group by Wednesday Sep 25th 11:59pm, we will assume you are working on your own.\n"," Under the group collaboration policy, besides working with your group member, you can discuss concepts with. your peers. However, the work must be by your own group, and all sources of information used including books, websites, students you talked to, must be cited in the submission. Please see the course FAQ document for details on this collaboration policy. We will adhere to current Faculty of Science guidelines on dealing with suspected cases of violation of academic integrity.\n","\n","You must use this notebook to complete your assignment. You will execute the questions in the notebook. The questions might ask for a short answer in text form or for you to write and execute a piece of code. **Make sure you enter your answer in either case only in the cell provided.**  Do not use a different cell and do not create a new cell. Do not delete any test cells.  Creating new cells for your code and deleting test cells is not compatible with the auto-grading system we are using and thus your assignment will not be graded properly and you will lose marks for that question.\n","\n","Your submitted notebook should run on our local installation.  So if you are importing packages not listed in the notebook or using local data files not included in the assignment package, make sure the notebook is self-contained with a requirements.txt file or cells in the notebook itself to install the extra packages.  If we cannot run your notebook, you will lose 50% of the marks, and any additional marks that may be lost due to wrong answers.\n","\n","### Submission Instructions\n","When you are done, you will submit your work from the notebook. Make sure to save your notebook before running it, and then submit on Canvas the notebook file with your work completed.\n","\n","**IMPORTANT: Name your file with your *Student ID number* and the assignment number (ex: 1234567_A1.ipynb).

This discrepancy raises several points for consideration regarding the effectiveness of the randomized response approach:\n","\n","**Overestimation:**\n","\n","\n","The estimated count of individuals earning over $50K is approximately three times higher than the actual count. This substantial overestimation indicates that the randomness incorporated into the response mechanism may have led to misleading results. Such a large gap suggests that the mechanism did not effectively capture the true distribution of responses.\n","\n","**Implications of Randomness:**\n","\n","\n","The randomized response method introduces randomness to protect the privacy of respondents. However, this randomness can dilute the accuracy of the estimates. If the probabilities used in the mechanism do not reflect the actual behavior of respondents, the resulting data may not be reliable.\n","The mechanism may inadvertently inflate the number of affirmative responses, thereby skewing the estimates upward.\n","\n","**Privacy-Accuracy Tradeoff**\n","\n","The randomized response mechanism illustrates a fundamental tradeoff between privacy and accuracy in survey data collection:\n","\n","**Enhanced Privacy:**\n","\n","One of the key benefits of using randomized response is that it allows respondents to provide answers to sensitive questions without fear of exposure. This can encourage more honest responses and increase participation in surveys concerning sensitive topics such as income.\n","In contexts where confidentiality is paramount, such mechanisms can be invaluable for obtaining data while protecting individuals' identities.\n","\n","**Reduced Accuracy:**\n","\n","While privacy is enhanced, the accuracy of the results may suffer. The randomization may result in a significant deviation from the actual values, as demonstrated by the estimated count compared to the true count.\n","\n","In this case, the substantial overestimate indicates that the randomized response mechanism could mislead policymaker, potentially leading to erroneous conclusions or decisions based on inaccurate data.\n","\n","**Finding the Balance:**\n","\n","Striking the right balance between privacy and accuracy is crucial for effective data collection. Adjustments to the randomization probabilities and further refinements to the methodology could help improve accuracy while maintaining a level of respondent confidentiality.\n","\n","While the randomized response mechanism enhances privacy for sensitive questions, the results from your analysis highlight a significant tradeoff with accuracy. The substantial overestimation of the true count suggests that further refinement of the mechanism is necessary to obtain reliable estimates.
